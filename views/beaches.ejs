            <p style="color: blue;">
                Just half an hour north of Auckland's Harbour Bridge, 
                the town of Orewa stretches inland from the edge of a stunning three-kilometre beach. 
                Itâ€™s an ideal destination for those who enjoy swimming, surfing, kayaking, windsurfing, 
                and kite surfing. For breathtaking coastal views, a stroll along the Millennium Walkway is a must.
                Beyond the beach, Orewa offers a variety of entertainment options, including golf at Gulf Harbour, 
                wine trails, hiking in regional parks, cycling, indoor skiing, and thermal hot pools. 
                The town also has a comprehensive shopping centre and a wide selection of dining options, 
                with plenty of accommodation available.
